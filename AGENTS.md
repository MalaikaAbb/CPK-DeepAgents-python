# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents (Codex and others) working in this repo. Read
`CLAUDE.md` for what this project is and how it is laid out, and
`PR_GUIDELINES.md` for branch and commit conventions. This file adds the rules
that matter most when updating the harness after a docs change, many of which
were learned the hard way.

## What this repo is for

It is a test harness for `docs.copilotkit.ai/<framework>`. Each route
implements what one doc page teaches, **as published**. The harness exists to
show whether the docs work, so a route that quietly does better than its page
is a bug in the harness.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Copy doc code verbatim, including its bugs.** Never correct a published
   snippet. If it fails to compile, keep it byte-for-byte and put
   `// @ts-expect-error <reason>` (or `# type: ignore[...]  # <reason>`) on the
   line above it, then record the mismatch in the README's
   *Known issues / doc-vs-implementation discrepancies* section. Never annotate
   parameters or rewrite the expression. Do not turn on
   `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors`. Prompts and config count as code.
2. **When the page leaves something out, borrow it from a sibling harness;
   never ask and never stop.** These runs are unattended: nobody answers
   questions. If the page doesn't publish something the feature needs:
   1. Look for the same doc page in the other harness repos (fresh clones in
      the siblings folder named in your brief). Find it through each repo's
      `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts` (a `docPath` ending in the same page
      path), then read that route's files and its backend agent.
   2. If a sibling has it, adapt the missing piece from there. Label it on the
      route as "from <sibling repo>, not the doc page", keep every piece the doc
      *does* publish verbatim (bugs included), and record it as a doc gap.
   3. If no sibling has it, check the CopilotKit showcase on GitHub
      (`CopilotKit/CopilotKit`, `showcase/integrations/<framework>/` and
      `showcase/shared/`), labelled the same way.
   4. If nothing usable exists anywhere, build the route as a reference-only
      page: the published code shown verbatim, a gap panel saying what's
      missing, status `broken`.
   Every borrowed or missing piece goes in the doc-gap entry, the README's
   Known issues, and the "Doc gaps / borrowed code" part of your final message.
   **Borrow only what the feature needs to work.** A Code tab, sibling route
   or showcase demo is not a list of files to copy. For every borrowed file,
   function, component, tool or dependency, ask: *is this needed for this
   page's hook/component to work?* and *why?*
   - **Needed by the package API** (the hook or component the page teaches
     won't run without it: a prop it requires, the agent/tool the page's
     snippet calls, the runtime route it talks to) → integrate it.
   - **Needed only by the showcase demo project** (demo styling, extra demo
     tools the page doesn't call, suggestion chips, design-skill prompts,
     decorative custom components, aimock/mock-LLM fixtures or headers when
     this harness doesn't use aimock, diagnostic logging, e2e/test helpers)
     → leave it out. At most mention it in the doc-gap entry.
   Keep the code the page itself shows verbatim; trim only the extras around it.
   **Backend: page code only.** Never add a backend tool, agent, graph
   assembly or system prompt that the referenced doc pages don't print — not
   from the showcase, not from a sibling, not written by you. If the page
   prints a tool but never builds the agent, copy just the tool, register
   nothing, and mark the route `broken`. If a page publishes no backend, use
   the generic backend snippet its own doc section prints (e.g. the
   `create_agent(tools=[], ...)` middleware snippet), not a custom prompt.
   Broken stays broken.

   **If it's broken, leave it broken. Never fix it, never silently.** This
   overrides everything above in this rule. When the page's code is missing a
   tool, an agent, a function, a helper or wiring, or the code as published
   doesn't work, do **not** fill the gap with sibling, showcase or your own
   code to make it run. Copy what the page prints, leave the gap, set the
   route `broken`, and say exactly what is missing in the route callout, the
   doc-gap entry, README Known issues and your final message. A silent fix (a
   workaround with no label, a stand-in that hides the gap, a "helpful"
   prompt tweak) is the worst outcome: the harness exists to show where the
   docs break.

   **Each framework runs its own agents.** Even when this framework's doc
   page prints a generic or other-framework agent (CopilotKit `BuiltInAgent`,
   a TanStack `BuiltInAgent` factory, `LangGraphAgent`, a LangGraph graph…),
   never build that agent in this harness. Use this framework's own agent
   (its backend agent, reached the way the repo's other runtime routes reach
   it), with the doc snippet's prompt and only the tools the snippet defines.
   Keep every CopilotKit API part of the snippet verbatim; only the agent
   construction changes. Label the swap on the route and record it as a doc
   gap. Never port another harness's agent across frameworks.

   **Custom UI components: only the ones the page's code references.** If
   page code imports or renders a component it never defines (a card, badge,
   button, picker, surface…), add that one component, borrowed from a sibling
   or the showcase where possible, minimal otherwise. Label it as not from
   the doc page and record it as a gap. Add nothing else: no components the
   page code doesn't name, no extra styling primitives, no layout wrappers.
3. **If a working remedy already exists, keep it.** Some routes have the
   verbatim doc class in one `#region` and a remedy subclass in a separate
   `#region <name>-remedy`. Update the verbatim part from the docs. Leave the
   remedy alone unless the doc change makes it unnecessary, and then say so in
   your final message.
4. **The `.md` source is not the framework's code.** `<page>.md` holds the
   default (often LangGraph or Python) snippets. The rendered page swaps in this
   framework's own code, and pages with a demo keep the full source in the
   **Code tab**. That data is in the page's RSC response:
   `curl -s -H 'RSC: 1' <page-url>`. It contains text rows `<id>:T<hexlen>,<bytes>`,
   referenced as `"code":"$<id>"`, with the file path nearby. Embedded demos
   iframe `feature-viewer.copilotkit.ai/<integration>/feature/<demo>?view=code`.
   Treat the rendered page and Code tab as the source of truth, and use the
   `.md` diff only to find what moved.
5. **Stay in scope.** Change only what the doc change requires. No refactors,
   no dependency bumps the page doesn't ask for, no edits to unrelated routes.
6. **Never touch** `doc-snapshot/` (the bot owns it), `.env*` files (except
   `.env.example` placeholders), `node_modules/`, `.venv/` or lockfiles by hand.
   Don't commit, push or create branches; the bot script does that.
7. **Never run `next dev`, `npm run dev` or long-lived servers.** This is an
   unattended run: a server that never exits hangs the job until it times
   out. The Turbopack dev cache has also caused OOM kills in these repos.

## Dependencies and version pins

- Add packages with `npm install --allow-remote=all <pkg>` (npm 12 refuses some
  optional deps without it). Don't add that flag to `.npmrc`.
- `@ag-ui/client` / `@ag-ui/core` must be the **exact** version that the
  installed `@copilotkit/react-core` pins, or two copies get installed and
  `AbstractAgent` types break with "separate declarations of a private
  property". On any CopilotKit bump, check with
  `find node_modules -path '*@ag-ui/client/package.json' -exec grep -m1 '"version"' {} \; | sort | uniq -c`
  and pin it in `dependencies` plus `overrides` if more than one copy shows up.
- A2UI needs **zod 3** (`zod@3.25.76` at the root). Under zod 4, bindings render
  blank with no error. Don't switch to `zod/v3` imports.
- Hashbrown doc code uses `prompt` and `useUiKit({ examples })`, which were
  removed in 0.8. Keep Hashbrown at the exact version the route already uses.

## Status, gaps and the README

When a doc change affects a route, keep all of these consistent:

- `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts`: the route's `status`
  (`working | partial | reference | broken | not-started`) and `statusNote`.
- Doc gaps (`frontend/src/lib/doc-gaps.ts` and the backend registry's `gaps`,
  where they exist): add an entry when the page omits something, and **delete**
  an entry when the page now publishes the missing piece.
- `README.md`: the walkthrough entry for the route, the status table row, and
  the discrepancies section. Write in your own words; don't paste doc prose.
- If a route mounts its own `<CopilotKit>`, add it to the nested-provider list
  in `frontend/src/lib/inspector.ts` so only one Inspector mounts.
- If a doc page now 404s, don't delete the route. Mark it `broken`, say "doc
  page returns 404" in the status note and the README table, and keep the code.

## Verifying your change

Run checks, not servers:

- Frontend type check: `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit`. `next dev` hides type
  errors that `next build` catches, and the bot runs `next build` after you.
- Python backend: `cd backend && uv run python -m compileall -q .`
- Node backend: `cd backend && npm run typecheck`

Errors that come from verbatim doc code are expected. Suppress them as in
rule 1 and record them. Don't fix them.

## Your final message

The bot pastes it into the PR, so use exactly these headings:

```
### What changed in the docs
<1–3 bullets, your own words>

### What I changed
<bullets: file → what and why>   (or "Nothing — prose-only change, no code affected.")

### Doc gaps / borrowed code
<bullets: what the page leaves out → where you took it from (sibling repo +
path, or showcase path), or "reference-only, nothing usable found"; or "None">

### Verbatim doc bugs kept
<bullets: doc code kept as published that fails or misbehaves, and how it's
suppressed/recorded; or "None">

### Notes for the reviewer
<judgment calls you made and what to test in the browser; or "None">

### Checks run
<command → pass/fail, with the key error line if it failed>
```

## deepagents specifics

- Docs root: `https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents`. Backend: Python with `uv`.
- **The TypeScript harness (`deepagents-ts`) tracks the same doc pages.** Here,
  implement the **Python** snippets and Code-tab files only.
