# ADAPT.md — porting this recorder to another CopilotKit integration

**Read this file before changing anything. Follow it in order.**

You are adapting a working screen-recording suite from one CopilotKit
integration to another. It currently records **Microsoft Agent Framework
(Python) + React**. The target might be `ms-agent-dotnet`, `agno`, `langgraph`,
an Angular frontend, or anything else CopilotKit documents.

The suite arrives **working**. You are editing a reference implementation, not
filling in blanks. If you find yourself writing a file from scratch, stop and
re-read this.

---

## Definition of done

```bash
npm run doctor          # static: config, files, line ranges, handlers
npm run doctor:online   # also: every demo route, every doc URL, the selectors
npm run record -- --<first-page-id>
```

`doctor` must exit **0**. Then one real recording must report `[PASS]` and the
video must be watchable.

Nothing else counts as finished. Not "the config looks right" — the doctor
exiting zero. If you cannot make it pass, say so and say which check fails;
do not describe the port as complete.

## What you may edit

| Path | Edit? | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `config/project.config.ts` | **Yes** | Framework slug, doc root, URLs, start commands |
| `config/pages.config.ts` | **Yes** | One entry per doc page |
| `config/selectors.config.ts` | **Yes** | How to find the chat surface in this frontend |
| `actions/*.action.ts` | **Yes** | What to do on a page that needs more than "send a prompt" |
| `actions/index.ts` | **Yes** | Which handler serves which page id |
| `core/**` | **No** | Engine, IDE simulator, overlays, cursor, doctor, defect helpers |
| `cli.ts` | **No** | Argument parsing and the run summary |

**Do not edit `core/`.** It contains no framework-specific knowledge — every
such value already comes from `config/`. If you believe a change to `core/` is
required, that is a finding to report, not a change to make quietly: it means
something framework-specific leaked into shared code, and every other repo using
this folder has the same problem.

---

## Step 1 — Identity

Edit `config/project.config.ts`. Every field has a comment saying what it is.

The one to get right is `framework`: the slug exactly as it appears in
`https://docs.copilotkit.ai/<framework>/...`. Doc URLs are built from it, so a
wrong slug silently records the wrong framework's documentation.

`videoPrefix` should identify both sides of the integration — `MSPY-react`,
`MSNET-react`, `AGNO-angular` — because these files end up in one folder
together.

If the backend is not Python, `backendStartCmd` and `backendHealthPath` change.
They are only ever printed or fetched; nothing parses them.

## Step 2 — Fetch the real doc nav

Do not copy the page list from another repo, and do not work from memory. Fetch
`https://docs.copilotkit.ai/<framework>` and read its sidebar.

Frameworks share most pages — quickstart, prebuilt components, slots, headless
UI, generative UI, shared state — but not all. Some lack pages the reference has;
some have pages it does not. A page that 404s is a finding worth reporting, not
something to quietly keep.

## Step 3 — The page registry

Edit `config/pages.config.ts`: delete pages this framework does not document,
add the ones it does, and put them in doc-nav order — order determines the number
in each video filename.

Entries are short because URLs and filenames are derived. Set `docPath` and
`route`; never write a full URL.

`startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights, and they are the
thing most likely to be wrong after a port. Open each `ideFile` and read the
range. If the frontend marks its interesting lines with `[!code highlight]` or
`#region`, keep those markers — the doctor uses them to detect drift later.

## Step 4 — The selector contract

Edit `config/selectors.config.ts`.

If the target frontend is React using CopilotKit's prebuilt components, the
defaults likely work unchanged. **If it is Angular, or the app renders its own
chat, they will not.** Open a demo page, inspect the real chat input, submit
control and assistant message, and write selectors that match those and nothing
else.

`assistantMessage` is the one to be careful with. It drives both "has the reply
started" and "has it finished". If it matches a container rather than individual
messages, every reply looks complete the instant it begins, and the videos show
prompts with no answers.

`npm run doctor:online` reports which selectors match nothing on a live page.

## Step 5 — The actions

Most pages need nothing: with no entry in `ACTION_MAP` they get
`runStandardAction`, which types the prompt, submits, and waits for the reply.

Write a handler only for pages that need more — switching tabs, clicking an
approval button, opening a panel. Copy the closest existing handler and build on
the helpers in `core/actions.ts` rather than re-implementing them:

```ts
const msgCount = await sendPrompt(page, config.prompt);
await waitForAgentResponseCompletion(page, config.waitAfterPromptMs ?? 4000, msgCount);
```

Pass that count through on multi-turn pages, or the previous turn's reply is
mistaken for this one's.

A handler's fourth argument, `ctx`, is how it reports what it saw. Use it
instead of `console.warn`, which reaches nobody:

```ts
export const runSharedStateReadAction: PageActionHandler = async (page, config, _rootPath, ctx) => {
  ...
  if (!toggleVisible) ctx.fail('"Toggle Language" button never rendered'); // [FAIL], clip still saved
  if (followed) ctx.warn('the panel followed the agent -- the documented defect did not reproduce'); // note on the result
};
```

`ctx.timeouts` carries the resolved waits for the page (see `core/timeouts.ts`;
override per project in `project.config.ts` or per page with `timeouts`).

Delete handlers for pages that no longer exist. The doctor warns about orphans.


## Step 5b — Pages that are *supposed* to be broken

Skip this unless the repo you are porting into tracks defects as well as
features. This one does: five of its pages are on a QA report as broken, and
their clips exist to show that.

A page declares its defect in `pages.config.ts`:

```ts
knownIssue: { area, problem, impact, likelyCause, expectsNoResponse? }
```

Three consequences, and it is worth knowing all three before adding one:

1. When the handler observes the defect and calls `ctx.reproduced(evidence)`,
   the run reports `[ISSUE]` rather than `[PASS]`, and does **not** set a
   non-zero exit code. Documented defects must not turn a nightly pipeline red;
   a pipeline that is red every night is one nobody reads. When it does not,
   the take is `[PASS*]` with "KNOWN ISSUE NOT REPRODUCED".
2. `writeIssueNote()` types the four fields into a simulated Notepad at the end
   of the take, over the still-visible failure.
3. Anything downstream — here, `ci/build-report.mjs` — renders the same object
   into the report that gets sent on.

`[ISSUE]` means "this page is on the known-issues list and the handler saw the
defect this take", and the result carries what it saw. It is only as good as
the handler's check, so watch the clip.

The doctor enforces two things. Every field must be non-empty, because each one
lands verbatim in a document someone sends to their manager. And the page must
have an action handler — a `knownIssue` page falling through to
`runStandardAction` would be labelled `[ISSUE]` and show no issue, which is the
one outcome worse than not recording it.

**Delete a `knownIssue` in the same change that confirms the fix.** A stale one
shows up as "KNOWN ISSUE NOT REPRODUCED" on every run until you do.

### Filming an absence

Most defects are an absence — a label that does not update, a list that stays
empty, a surface that never draws. On video an empty panel beside a working chat
is indistinguishable from a page nobody has asked anything yet. Three helpers
exist for this, all in `core/`:

The rule is that a take may only contain things a person testing the app could
actually have done. A caption bar and a replica of Chrome's DevTools console
were built for this and then deleted for breaking it — an overlay nobody could
have summoned turns a recording of evidence into a recording of a presentation.

| Helper | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `showWorkingVariant()` | The same page against code that works — the only thing that answers "was the demo just wired up wrong?" |
| `writeIssueNote()` | Notepad, opened from the taskbar and typed into. Give each issue a `note` written the way a person scribbles, not the way a report is filed. |
| `captureConsole()` | Invisible. Console-only failures reach the run log and the note, never the screen. |

`showWorkingVariant` needs something to compare against. Where the fix is known,
carry **paired routes**: the doc's code verbatim, and a sibling differing by
exactly the omitted line. Only pair where the fix is genuinely known — a "fixed"
route that quietly does something else is worse evidence than no pair. Where
there is no known fix, contrast against a sibling that already works.

---

## Step 6 — Prove it

```bash
npm run doctor:online
npm run record -- --<first-page-id>
```

Then **watch the video**. The doctor cannot tell you the cursor rested somewhere
useless or the IDE highlighted the wrong function. Check: the doc page scrolls
and the taskbar is visible; the IDE shows the code the page is about; the demo
gets a real answer.

Then record the rest.

---

## Things that will bite you

**A page that never answers now fails the run.** That is deliberate — it used to
report `[PASS]`. If a page fails this way, the demo is broken or
`assistantMessage` does not match; both are real findings.

**Pages that replace the message view.** A page that swaps in a custom message
component renders none of CopilotKit's classes, so detection finds nothing and
reports "agent never responded" on a page that works. Pass a per-page selector
instead of widening the global one:

```ts
await sendPrompt(page, prompt, { messageSelector: '.my-custom-bubble' });
await waitForAgentResponseCompletion(page, wait, msgCount, '.my-custom-bubble');
```

`actions/slots.action.ts` does exactly this for its level-3 tab.

**Controls underneath the taskbar overlay.** The simulated taskbar occupies the
bottom 48px and swallows clicks. A send button sitting there never receives the
click; the submit lands via the Enter fallback instead. Harmless, but do not
spend an afternoon on why a click "did nothing".

**Line ranges drift silently.** Nothing errors when a range points at the wrong
code — the video just shows the wrong thing. Re-run `npm run doctor` after
touching the frontend.

**Not every page can use the shared helper.** One page in the reference
(`headless-ui`) is deliberately left on its own implementation because routing it
through `sendPrompt` broke it. If a page misbehaves only after you "tidied" it,
put it back and leave a comment saying why.

## Reporting back

When you finish, state:

- which pages you added, removed, or renumbered, and why
- any doc page that 404s or is missing from the nav for this framework
- which selectors you had to change
- any page whose recording fails, and the doctor output for it
- anything that made you want to edit `core/`

A port that silently drops pages to make the doctor pass is worse than one that
reports three failures honestly.
