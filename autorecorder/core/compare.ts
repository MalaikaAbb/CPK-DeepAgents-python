/**
 * The second half of a defect take: the same page, on code that works.
 *
 * A clip of something failing is weak evidence on its own. The reader's first
 * question is always whether the demo was wired up wrong, and a video cannot
 * answer that by insisting. It can answer it by doing the same thing twice --
 * once on the code the documentation prints, once with the one line the
 * documentation omits -- and letting the difference be the whole argument.
 *
 * That is why this repo carries paired routes. `/shared-state/in-app-agent-write`
 * is the doc's code verbatim; `/shared-state/in-app-agent-write/fixed` is the
 * same page against a graph built with `CopilotKitMiddleware(expose_state=[...])`.
 * Nothing else differs, which is exactly what makes the pair worth recording.
 *
 * Only build a pair where the fix is actually known. Two of the defects here
 * have no established fix, and a "fixed" route that quietly does something else
 * would be worse evidence than no second route at all.
