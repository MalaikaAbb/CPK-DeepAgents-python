/**
 * The scribbled note at the end of a defect take.
 *
 * Every issue clip ends the same way: the tester opens Notepad over the still
 * visible failure and writes down what just happened.
 *
 * It is written the way a person writes at the end of a test, not the way a
 * report is filed. Lower case, no headings, no "Expected impact:" labels --
 * just what was done, what happened, and what it probably means. The formal
 * version of the same finding is what goes into DOCUMENTED_REPORT.md from the
 * very same `KnownIssue`; that one is for the
 * manager, this one is a person thinking out loud on camera. A neatly formatted
 * memo appearing in Notepad at human typing speed reads as staged, which is the
 * one thing these clips cannot afford.
