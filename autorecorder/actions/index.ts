 *
 * What the recorder *does* on each demo page once it is open.
 *
 * The registry lives here rather than in `core/` on purpose: adding or removing
 * a page must never mean editing frozen code. A page with no entry falls back
 * to `runStandardAction` — type the prompt, submit, wait for the reply — which
 * is right for most pages. Write a handler only when a page needs more than
 * that: switching tabs, clicking an approval button, opening a panel.
 *
 * Handlers should build on the helpers in `core/actions.ts`:
 *
 *   sendPrompt(page, prompt, opts)          types and submits, returns the
 *                                           assistant-message count from before
 *                                           submitting
 *   waitForAgentResponseCompletion(...)     waits for the reply to finish, and
 *                                           throws if none ever arrives
 *   promptsFor(config)                      the page's prompts[] , or [prompt]
 *
 * Pass that returned count into waitForAgentResponseCompletion on multi-turn
 * pages, or the previous turn's reply is mistaken for this one's.
 *
 * The fourth argument, `ctx`, is how a handler reports what it saw:
 *
 *   ctx.warn('the documented defect did not reproduce')  -> [PASS*]/[ISSUE] with the note
 *   ctx.fail('Approve button never rendered')             -> [FAIL], clip still saved
 *
 * A `console.warn` reaches nobody: the summary, RECORD_RESULTS.json and the
 * QA report only see what goes through `ctx`.
 *
 * ── Handlers for pages that reproduce a defect ─────────────────────────────
 * Pages here that carry a `knownIssue` give their handlers extra obligations:
 * detect the defect, make it visible, then write it down.
 *
 * Detect first. A take is `[ISSUE]` only when the handler calls
 * `ctx.reproduced('<what it saw>')` with the observed value -- a console line,
 * a panel's text, a computed colour. Declaring a defect is not evidence of it;
 * without the call the take reports KNOWN ISSUE NOT REPRODUCED. The Notepad
 * note is written only when the defect was seen, and only says what was seen:
 * a note typed regardless of the result keeps "proving" a bug after it is
 * fixed. Where part of a `knownIssue` cannot be observed in a take (a source
 * fact, an install-time 404), the handler says so in a comment rather than
 * claiming it.
 *
 * The governing rule is that a take may only contain things a person testing
 * this app could actually have done. That rule cost this suite two helpers it
 * used to have — a caption bar and a replica of Chrome's DevTools console,
 * both painted over the page. Both were useful. Neither was something a tester
 * could produce, and an overlay nobody could have summoned turns a recording of
 * evidence into a recording of a presentation. What survives:
 *
 *   showWorkingVariant(page, opts)     core/compare.ts — the same page against
 *                                      code that works, which is what answers
 *                                      "was the demo just wired up wrong?"
 *   writeIssueNote(page, id, issue)    core/issue-note.ts — Notepad, opened
 *                                      from the taskbar and typed into, which
 *                                      is how a tester actually reports
 *   captureConsole(page)               core/console-capture.ts — invisible.
 *                                      Console errors reach the run log and the
 *                                      note, not the screen
 *
 * Anything a clip needs to *say* rather than show is said in the Notepad
 * note, or in a narration track. The demo routes briefly carried a short
 * "Try / Expected / Actual" block for this and no longer do, so a page
 * whose defect is an absence needs its `knownIssue.note` to carry the
 * whole explanation on its own.
