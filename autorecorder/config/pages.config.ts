 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 3 of 3
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One entry per doc page, in the order the doc nav lists them.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately short. `docUrl`, `demoUrl` and the output filename
 * are derived from `project.config.ts` plus the fields below, so no entry can
 * point at the wrong framework's docs and filenames stay in nav order without
 * anyone numbering them by hand.
 *
 * ── The line ranges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights. They are
 * hardcoded, which means they drift the moment someone edits a demo page.
 * Doctor guards this: where a file carries `[!code highlight]` or `#region`
 * markers, it checks the range still covers one and names the marker's current
 * line when it does not. Keep those markers in the frontend and the guard keeps
 * working.
 *
 * ── `knownIssue` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This repo is not only documenting an integration that works. Ten of the
 * pages below are on the QA report as broken, and their clips exist to show
 * that. `knownIssue` is what makes the run say `[ISSUE]` rather than `[PASS]`,
 * and it is the same object that is written to RECORD_RESULTS.json for the QA
 * report — so the sentence typed into Notepad on video and the row that goes
 * to the manager are one string, written here, once.
 *
 * A page whose defect gets fixed upstream should have its `knownIssue` deleted
 * in the same change that confirms the fix. Leaving a stale one behind is worse
 * than having none: the clip keeps asserting a bug that is gone.
 */

import { definePages } from '../core/types';

/**
 * Pages that stay registered but are never filmed.
 *
 * They keep their route, their doctor entry and their `--list` entry, so doc
 * drift still tracks them and the findings still hold. Only the camera is
 * off. A page belongs here when a clip would show nothing the findings do not
 * already say, or would film a wall rather than the feature.
 *
 * Intelligence and the new upstream markdown page are excluded by standing
 * instruction from the project owner, not by accident. Do not re-enable one
 * without asking: an empty entry here is how a page silently starts recording
 * again.

      problem:
        'All three published blocks are a bare `<CopilotChat>` carrying only `messageView`, so they ask ' +
        'for the agent id "default", which a Deep Agents runtime does not register, and the route throws ' +
        '"Agent \'default\' not found after runtime sync" as soon as `/info` answers. None of the three ' +
        'carries `"use client"` either, although each is titled `page.tsx` and passes inline functions ' +
        'to a client component.',
      impact:
        'A Deep Agents reader who copies any block on this page gets a crashed route rather than a ' +
        'restyled message, and the page never names the prop that fixes it. With `agentId` added the ' +
        'rest of the page holds exactly as written -- the override runs, the link hardening survives the ' +
        'spread, `data-streamdown` disappears -- but the headline `components` example styles with ' +
        '`.my-link` and `.my-heading`, which the page never defines, so following it end to end changes ' +
        'nothing a reader can see.',
      likelyCause:
        'The page is written framework-agnostically and assumes an agent registered as "default". The ' +
        'Deep Agents Quickstart names its agent `sample_agent` and puts the id on the provider; none of ' +
        'these blocks has a provider at all. The same assumption already broke Frontend-Driven Cards ' +
