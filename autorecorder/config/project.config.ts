 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 1 of 3

 *
 * Who this project is: which CopilotKit integration it tests, where its docs
 * live, and how its two services are reached and started.
 *
 * Everything else derives from this. Doc and demo URLs are built from
 * `docBaseUrl` and `frontendUrl`, so a page never repeats them and no page can
 * point at a different framework's docs by accident.
 *
 * `npm run doctor` rejects any field still set to REPLACE_ME, so a half-done
 * adaptation cannot pass as finished.

   * time compiling instead of answering, and the recorder reports that the agent
   * never replied. Measured here at 59s of compile inside a 74s request.

   * The request is expected to fail (a GET against a POST-only route answers
   * 405); compiling it is the whole point. Set to '' to skip.
