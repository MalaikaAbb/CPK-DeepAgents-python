/**
 * DOCUMENTED_REPORT.md — the QA report that gets sent on, built from the run.
 *
 * This is the deliverable. Everything else in `ci/` exists to produce a folder
 * of videos; this turns that folder into the document those videos are evidence
 * for, in the format the report has always been filed in.
 *
 * The reason it is generated rather than written is that the alternative has a
 * specific, predictable failure: a status table maintained by hand drifts away
 * from the recordings beside it, and the drift is invisible because both halves
 * still look right on their own. Here a page's status comes from what the
 * recorder actually observed, and its issue text comes from the same
 * `knownIssue` object the recorder typed into Notepad on video. The report and
 * the footage cannot disagree, because they are the same source.
 *
 * `[ISSUE]` means the recorder observed the page's declared defect this run
 * (`ctx.reproduced`), and the row says what it saw. A declared defect that did
 * not show up is a PASS with a warning, never a canned failure row.
