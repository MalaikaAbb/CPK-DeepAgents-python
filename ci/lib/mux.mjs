 * narrated page got its audio muxed, and consolidate then muxed the same track
 * onto the already-muxed file. Muxing now happens once, where the video is
 * produced; the workflow just installs ffmpeg and lets this run.
 *
 * WebM cannot carry AAC — the audio is re-encoded to libopus. Missing ffmpeg
 * is a skip, not a failure: a silent demo still beats no demo.

 * `DAPY-react-06-InterruptBased.webm`, and narrating a new page is a matter of
 * dropping a correctly named file in — there is no list here to keep in sync.
 *
 * There used to be one, because the takes were named by hand and drifted from
 * the video names (`deepagentsreact-a2uifixedscheme-error.m4a` for
 * `A2uiFixedSchema`). Renaming the files to match retired the table.
 *
 * The match is on the `-<videoName>.webm` suffix rather than `includes`, so the
 * numeric prefix is ignored — the videos renumber whenever the nav order
 * changes — while a name that is a substring of another still cannot collide.
 *
 * Only the top level of `audio/` is scanned. `audio/on-hold/` is where a
 * narration goes when its take should ship silent for now — a page whose defect
 * has been fixed, so the commentary describes something the video no longer
 * shows. Moving the file back is the whole of re-enabling it.
