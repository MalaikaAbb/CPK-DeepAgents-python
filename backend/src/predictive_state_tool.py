"""Custom graph backing Predictive State Updates — tool-emission variant.

https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/predictive-state-updates?agent-type=custom-graph&state-emission=tool-emission

Also not a Deep Agent, and still the most complete of the page's Python
snippets. As of the 30 Aug revision it is complete outright: the import block,
`AgentState`, `step_progress_tool`, `chat_node`, `route_after_chat`, the
`StateGraph` wiring and the `compile` are all printed on the page, so this
module is that snippet end to end rather than the old mix of Python tab plus
TypeScript-tab scaffolding.

What changed, and why the shape of this file changed with it:

* `step_progress_tool` used to be a bare `def` with a docstring and no body —
  the model's *argument* was the whole payload and the tool never ran. It now
  takes a `ToolRuntime` and returns a `Command` that writes `observed_steps`
  and appends a `ToolMessage` carrying `runtime.tool_call_id`. The tool
  executes.
* Because it executes, the graph needs somewhere to execute it. The old single
  node routed to `END` on both paths; there is now a real `ToolNode` and a
  `route_after_chat` conditional edge, and `tool_node` loops back to
  `chat_node`.
* `emit_intermediate_state` still streams the `steps` argument into
  `observed_steps` as the model writes it — that is the prediction, unchanged.
  What replaced the old `Command(goto=END, update=...)` reconciliation is the
  tool's own `Command(update=...)`. Both halves are still the page's.

Two departures, both pre-existing:

* The page pins `ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.4")`; every agent here reads
  `OPENAI_MODEL` so a tester needs access to one model rather than four.
* `compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())` is the page's and is *not* kept. It
  is the one line of the revision that cannot go in verbatim: `langgraph dev`
  rejects a graph carrying its own checkpointer and aborts startup for the
  entire app, taking all fourteen other graphs down with it. Dropped here and
  reported; the long note on the `graph` region has the error and the
  reasoning.
