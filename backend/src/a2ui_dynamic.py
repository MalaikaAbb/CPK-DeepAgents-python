"""Agent backing the Dynamic Schema A2UI route.

https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/generative-ui/a2ui/dynamic-schema

The page's Python verbatim, except that the model id in
`ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-6-luna", reasoning_effort="none")` is read from `.env`
like every other agent here. `reasoning_effort="none"` is kept as printed
(doc-sync 2026-11-11); OpenAI rejects it for non-reasoning models, so
`OPENAI_MODEL` must name a reasoning-capable model (e.g. the default
`gpt-5.4-mini`), not `gpt-4o`.

There is deliberately nothing else in this file. The page's point is that the
backend needs no A2UI code at all: `CopilotKitMiddleware` injects and executes
`generate_a2ui` on its own once A2UI is switched on, and the switch lives on
the frontend — `a2ui={{ catalog }}` on the provider.

The A2UI Styling and Advanced routes drive this same agent; neither has a
backend of its own.
