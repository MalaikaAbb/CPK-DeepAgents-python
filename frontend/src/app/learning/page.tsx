          Learning groups Threads from one kind of work into a container,
          analyzes completed runs into Insights, and proposes Skills you review
          and publish. The only code the page asks for is one runtime callback,{" "}
          <code>getLearningContainerId</code>, that decides which container a
          new Thread joins. This route mounts that runtime verbatim at{" "}
          <code>/api/copilotkit-learning</code> with one agent it assigns
          (<code>expense-agent</code>) and one it does not
          (<code>sample_agent</code>, the Deep Agents Quickstart&apos;s id), both
          on the Quickstart graph.

        <code>apiKey: process.env.CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY!</code> — the{" "}
        <code>!</code> tells the type checker the key is there, and the page
        never says it has to be. This harness has no key, so
        the constructor throws at import time, the route answers 500, the
        provider lands in <code>error</code>, and the chat on either tab never
        enables its send button. Mounted anywhere shared, the same line would
        take down every chat on that runtime; here it is isolated on its own
        route. The page names the Intelligence Quickstart as a prerequisite
        only implicitly.

        <code>new CopilotRuntime({"{ agents, intelligence, identifyUser }"})</code>{" "}
        — <code>agents</code> and <code>identifyUser</code> appear nowhere else
        on the page. They are supplied in <code>lib/learning-runtime.ts</code>,
        above the verbatim block, and marked as this harness&apos;s. For Deep
        Agents, <code>agents</code> means <code>LangGraphAgent</code>s keyed by
        the id the selector tests — <code>expense-agent</code> is not a graph id
        this backend has, so it is mapped onto the Quickstart graph.

        this repo&apos;s lockfile pinned until 2026-09-23, the option is a type
        error (1.69.0 has only the <code>ɵlearning</code> runtime option). This
        repo now declares <code>^1.73.3</code> and installs 1.73.3, where it
        compiles. The page names no
        version and never mentions <code>ɵlearning</code>, so a reader on an
        older runtime is not told what to use instead.

        <p>
          The 2026-09-21 sync replaced the one-line pointer to{" "}
          <code>/deepagents/intelligence/learned-skills</code> with a three-step{" "}
          <strong>Set up skill delivery</strong> section. Step 2 tells
          you to configure &ldquo;the supported native adapter&rdquo; in the
          agent server environment with this block:
        </p>
        <pre className="mt-3 overflow-x-auto rounded bg-slate-900 p-3 text-xs text-slate-100">
          {AGENT_ENV}
        </pre>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The agent server here is Python, and the LangGraph Python adapter that
          would read those variables,{" "}
          <code>copilotkit-intelligence-langgraph</code>, is not on PyPI. See{" "}
          <Link
            href="/intelligence/learned-skills"
            className="underline underline-offset-4"
          >
            Skill delivery
          </Link>
          . So the environment block configures nothing, and step 3 (&ldquo;
          Verify delivery in a new invocation&rdquo;) has nothing to verify.
          Step 2 no longer lists frameworks; it says &ldquo;Pick the adapter for
          the agent you already run.&rdquo; For this repo that is LangGraph
          Python, the unpublished one. The new &ldquo;Collect runs and deliver
          Skills&rdquo; section points agent setup at the Mastra, LangGraph
          TypeScript or LangGraph Python example, in that order, and names
          BuiltInAgent only among the others the delivery guide &ldquo;also
          covers&rdquo;. BuiltInAgent&apos;s <code>learnedSkills</code> now
          compiles on the installed runtime (1.73.3), but it replaces the Deep
          Agent rather than attaching to it, so it is not the adapter for the
          agent this repo runs.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The container id in the block is <code>expense-review</code>, the same
          one this page&apos;s runtime selector returns, so the two halves agree
          about the name. Nothing here can check that they agree about anything
          else.

      <Callout tone="premium" title="The daily schedule is dashboard-only">
        The same sync added a <strong>Choose the daily schedule</strong> step
        and a threshold to <strong>Collect examples</strong>: automatic Learning
        wants <strong>15 eligible Threads</strong> and runs on a daily schedule
        defaulting to <strong>02:00 UTC</strong>, editable per project or per
        organization. Every part of that is a dashboard control: <strong>Edit
        schedule</strong>, <strong>Next scheduled run</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Start manual run now</strong>, <strong>Analysis results</strong>
        . All of it sits behind a provisioned project and a login this harness
        does not have. Two of the new troubleshooting rows are about that surface
        (&ldquo;An automatic run has not started&rdquo;, &ldquo;Learning is
        waiting after a failed run&rdquo;). None of it is on the clip.
