          CopilotKit forwards the whole transcript on every run. For an agent
          that stores its own history that is a second copy, and the page shows
          three ways to forward less: a <code>messageFilter</code> prop on the
          provider, an AG-UI middleware attached inside the runtime, and the same
          middleware on an agent you construct yourself.

        ignored prop. It first ships in 1.73.1 (published 2026-09-22), the day
        after this page went live. The repo now declares <code>^1.73.3</code>{" "}
        and installs 1.73.3, the demo&apos;s <code>@ts-expect-error</code> went
        unused as intended, and it has been removed. The page names no minimum
        version. Whether the prop now does what the page says (trimming the
        request body, repairing split tool-call pairs, re-applying across agent
        replacement) has not been re-observed here.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="The runtime snippet assumes an AG-UI endpoint this integration does not serve">
        The page builds its agent as{" "}
        <code>new HttpAgent(&#123; url: process.env.AGENT_URL! &#125;)</code>.
        An <code>HttpAgent</code> posts AG-UI to a URL; this backend is{" "}
        <code>langgraph dev</code>, which speaks the LangGraph Platform API and
        is reached with <code>LangGraphAgent</code>, as the Deep Agents
        Quickstart does. The page never says what <code>AGENT_URL</code> is, and
        there is nothing here to point it at, so the route keeps the line
        verbatim and leaves it unset. Run, the page&apos;s <code>default</code>{" "}
        agent returns{" "}
        <code>RUN_ERROR &quot;Cannot read properties of undefined (reading &apos;toString&apos;)&quot;</code>
        . The page&apos;s own claim that <code>.use()</code> is on{" "}
        <code>AbstractAgent</code> &ldquo;so this works for any agent&rdquo;
        does hold: the same middleware on the Quickstart&apos;s{" "}
        <code>LangGraphAgent</code> (<code>sample_agent</code>, marked NOT FROM
        THE PAGE) trims as described.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="info" title="The middleware works as published">
        <code>trim-history.ts</code> compiles on <code>@ag-ui/client</code>{" "}
        0.0.59 and the page&apos;s own check passes (
        <code>trim-history: forwarded only the answered call, next to its result</code>
        ). The check script&apos;s line{" "}
        <code>answers.add(trimmedParallel[i].toolCallId)</code> is a TS2339 error
        as published, because the loop condition does not narrow the element it
        reads again. It runs; it does not typecheck.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="success" title="On Deep Agents, trimming is safe because the checkpointer keeps the history">
        This is the case the page is written for. LangGraph checkpoints every
        thread, so the first turn is already on the server when the second run
        arrives with only the last user message. Observed 2026-09-22:
        <pre className="mt-3 overflow-x-auto rounded bg-slate-900 p-3 text-xs text-slate-100">
          {OBSERVED}

        <p className="mt-2">
          The single-run rows prove the middleware really drops messages: with
          no stored history, the trimmed agent never sees the name. The
          two-run rows prove that on a real thread nothing is lost. One caveat
          on the control: the curl transcript&apos;s <code>Ok.</code> carried an
          id the server had never issued, and the untrimmed runtime stored it
          as a second AI message beside the model&apos;s own reply; the trimmed
          thread held exactly four messages. That duplicate is a property of the
          hand-built transcript, not something a browser session was seen to
          do. The <code>RUN_STARTED</code> event&apos;s <code>input</code> still
          echoes all three messages on the trimmed runtime: the middleware
          rewrites what the agent receives, not what the event reports.
