/**
 * NOT FROM THE PAGE. The runtime option Memories & Recall never mentions.
 *
 * The page says memory "is not a feature flag" and that `isAvailable: false` is
 * what an unentitled deployment looks like. The runtime has a gate before
 * entitlement is ever consulted: every `/memories/*` request 404s at the
 * runtime unless it is constructed with `memory: { access }` (or the deprecated
 * `exposeMemoryRoutes: true`) — a "secure default", per the runtime's own
 * typings, present on 1.69.0 (this repo's lockfile until 2026-09-23) and on
 * the 1.71.0 installed alongside it alike; not re-checked on the 1.73.3 installed since.
 * `/api/copilotkit`, built the way the Deep Agents Quickstart builds it, has
 * neither (and no `intelligence` either), so the page's `useMemories()`
 * reports unavailable there no matter what the organization is entitled to.
 *
 * This mount is an Intelligence runtime over the same graphs with that one
 * option added, granting the user read-write. The typings only accept `memory`
 * on an Intelligence runtime, which needs `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY`. This
 * harness has no key, so without one the mount answers
 * 503 and says why, rather than pretending to be something it is not.
