 * The Learning page's runtime, mounted multi-route so the thread subtree is
 * served too — assignment is per Thread, and a Thread is what the page tells
 * you to look for afterwards.
 *
 * Without `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` the module throws on load (the page's
 * `apiKey: process.env.CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY!` asserts a key it does not
 * check), so this route answers 500 and nothing else in the app is affected.
