          thread with <code>setActiveThreadId(id, {"{"} explicit: true {"}"})</code>{" "}

          survives a remount. A ledger keeps every id the chat has been on, so a
          re-mint reads as a before and after.

          chat; after, the same <em>New chat</em> button does nothing, and the

        The page separates CopilotKit&apos;s threads from the framework&apos;s own
        persistence, and for a Deep Agent that framework is LangGraph. Its
        checkpointer receives the same <code>threadId</code> as the AG-UI thread
        id, but it is not what restores this chat: the runtime&apos;s runner is.
        Nothing here reads LangGraph&apos;s checkpoint store.
