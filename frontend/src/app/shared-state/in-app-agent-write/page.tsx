          Two buttons, because the page has two variants. <strong>Toggle
          Language</strong> writes and waits — nothing happens until you send a
          message. <strong>Toggle + re-run agent</strong> (on the{" "}
          <code>expose_state</code> side of the pair) is the page&apos;s
          &ldquo;Re-run the agent with updated state&rdquo; section: it starts a
          run immediately, and the agent replies in the new language without
          you typing anything. Since the 2026-11-11 sync that section calls{" "}
          <code>copilotkit.runAgent({"{ agent }"})</code> from{" "}
          <code>useCopilotKit()</code> rather than <code>agent.runAgent()</code>
          , so the run carries frontend tools and context.

          <code>setState</code> puts <code>language</code> on the agent, and the
          agent can read it in tools and hooks — but nothing puts it in front of

          which serialises the named keys into the system message on every model
          call. It is real API in <code>copilotkit 0.1.94</code> and defaults to
          off — deliberately, so state is not leaked into prompts by accident.
          Neither Shared State page mentions it exists.
