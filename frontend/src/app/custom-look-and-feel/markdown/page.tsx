      <Callout tone="warn" title="“Drop `node`” is a lint warning in a stock Next project">
        The page is right that <code>node</code> must come out — spread it and
        the renderer writes <code>node=&quot;[object Object]&quot;</code> into
        the document. But the way it says to remove it, destructuring the name
        and never using it, is what{" "}
        <code>@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars</code> is for, and the config a{" "}
        <code>create-next-app</code> project ships with reports it:{" "}
        <code>&apos;node&apos; is defined but never used</code>, once per
        overridden tag. Four of them here, because the published block
        overrides two tags and this route ships it twice. The snippet is
        unchanged and the warnings stand; a page that hands a reader a pattern
        their own linter rejects should say which of the two is wrong.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="No block on the page carries `use client`">
        Each snippet is titled <code>page.tsx</code> and passes inline arrow
        functions as props to <code>&lt;CopilotChat&gt;</code>, which is a
        client component. Under the App Router a <code>page.tsx</code> with no{" "}
        <code>&quot;use client&quot;</code> is a Server Component, and passing a
        function prop across that boundary is refused at render. The directive
        is on line 1 of <code>chat-variants.tsx</code> here and appears nowhere
        on the page.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="success" title="The slot mechanics are exactly as described">
        Read out of the shipped 1.71.0 bundle rather than inferred. A string is{" "}
        <code>twMerge</code>d onto the renderer&apos;s own{" "}
        <code>className</code>, so &ldquo;merged onto the markdown
        container&rdquo; is literal. A component is created with the slot&apos;s
        bound props and nothing else, and those props are{" "}
        <code>&#123; content: message.content || &quot;&quot; &#125;</code>, so
        &ldquo;receives exactly one prop&rdquo; is literal too. An object is
        spread over the default renderer&apos;s props, and the default renderer
        forwards everything but <code>content</code> straight to{" "}
        <code>&lt;Streamdown&gt;</code>, which is how <code>components</code>{" "}
        arrives. <code>CopilotSidebar</code> and <code>CopilotPopup</code> take{" "}
        <code>messageView</code> through{" "}
        <code>Omit&lt;CopilotChatProps, &quot;chatView&quot;&gt;</code>, so the
        page&apos;s &ldquo;works the same way&rdquo; holds on the type level.

      <Callout tone="success" title="Link hardening does reach your component">
        The page says an <code>a</code> is handed <code>href</code>,{" "}
        <code>target</code> and <code>rel</code>, with{" "}
        <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;</code>{" "}
        already applied. It is not the anchor component that applies them:
        Streamdown runs <code>rehype-harden</code> 1.1.8 as one of its default
        rehype plugins, and that plugin writes{" "}
        <code>node.properties.target = &quot;_blank&quot;</code> and{" "}
        <code>node.properties.rel = &quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;</code> onto
        the tree. Because it is on the tree rather than in the component, an
        override that spreads its props keeps it — which is what the page says,
        and what the probe is there to read back off the live reply.
        Streamdown&apos;s own{" "}
        <code>MarkdownA</code> hardcodes the weaker{" "}
        <code>rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;</code> and is then overwritten by the
        same spread, so the page&apos;s quoted value is the one that ships.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="The page's headline example changes nothing you can see">
        <code>components</code> is the technique the page says to &ldquo;reach
        for first&rdquo;, and its example sets{" "}
        <code>className=&quot;my-link&quot;</code> and{" "}
        <code>className=&quot;my-heading&quot;</code>. Neither class is defined
        anywhere on the page, and no step tells you to define them. In a
        Tailwind project — which is what the snippet&apos;s own{" "}
        <code>text-sm leading-7</code> example assumes two sections later —
        they match no utility, so following the primary example end to end
        replaces two working components with two that look worse and produces
        no visible change at all. The demo ships it unchanged and the probe
        counts the elements the classes landed on, which is the only way to see
        that it did anything.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="“You are replacing, not extending” is understated">
        The page names the lost <code>data-streamdown</code> attribute and the
        lost classes. What it does not say is that the default anchor is a
        memoized component with its own equality check, and that the default
        heading, list, table and code components carry the same marks — so a
        one-tag override silently opts that tag out of Streamdown&apos;s
        incomplete-markdown handling as well (<code>data-incomplete</code>,
        which the shipped anchor sets and a hand-written one does not). Compare
        the <strong>components map</strong> and <strong>no override</strong>{" "}
        tabs: the mark count drops by the number of anchors and{" "}
        <code>h2</code> headings in the reply, not by nothing.

      <Callout tone="success" title="Custom tags: the page's error message is exact">
        <code>Components</code> in streamdown 1.6.11 is keyed by{" "}
        <code>keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements</code>, so{" "}
        <code>&quot;reference-chip&quot;</code> is rejected with precisely the
        TS2353 the page prints. One thing the page leaves out: the same line
        also raises TS7031, because an unknown key carries no contextual type
        for the component&apos;s props, so a reader who copies the example sees
        two errors and is told to expect one. The runtime half holds as well —
        Streamdown&apos;s default rehype chain includes{" "}
        <code>rehype-sanitize</code> with the default schema, which drops an
        unknown element and keeps its text.
