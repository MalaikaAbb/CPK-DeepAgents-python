/**
 * Jev: fast generative UI — step 1, "Define the state and candidate IDs".
 *
 * Published as `lib/workspaces.ts` in two blocks that the page says go in the
 * same file; both are below, in order, unedited. This is the one file of the
 * recipe that both compiles and runs here, so it is imported for real by
 * `prepared-controls.tsx`.
 *
 * Deviations, all of them locational: the file lives under the route rather
 * than at `lib/workspaces.ts`, because this harness is one app per doc section
 * and a `@/lib` path would collide with the other twenty-two. Nothing in
 * either block changed.
 *
 * Version note the page does not survive: it pins `zod@4.6.5`. This repo has
 * zod 3.25.76 (declared `^3.25.76`). The two blocks happen to be valid on
 * both — `z.object`, `z.enum`, `.nullable()`, `.default()`, `.min()` and
 * `z.infer` all mean the same thing in 3 and 4 — so the schema is shipped
 * unchanged and typechecks. That is luck, not compatibility; see FINDINGS.md.
