          compare rooms — is chosen by Jev, TypeSafe&apos;s decision service,
          and whose rooms are ranked by Jev fit scores. CopilotKit and AG-UI
          carry the resulting state to React; the application owns the schemas,
          the components, the fixed labels and the confirmed actions.

          has no account with. The fallback path needs{" "}
          <code>@langchain/openai</code>, also absent. Everything else in the
          recipe is here verbatim, and the split between the two halves is
          drawn by the compiler rather than asserted: every published

        hand-written TypeScript <code>AbstractAgent</code> living inside the

        <code>app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts</code> — the file the
        Deep Agents Quickstart tells you to create, pointing at a{" "}

        <code>new PickerAgent()</code> and reaches no backend at all. Following
        it inside a Deep Agents project means deleting the integration the
        section documents. This harness runs a Python backend on{" "}
        <code>:8030</code>, so the recipe&apos;s stack is not reachable from
        this integration at all: there is no step that connects the two, and
        the page never says one is needed.

        direction, <code>copilotkit_emit_state</code> for streaming — and none

        <code>expose_state</code>, because there is no Python model reading the
        state, so the one prerequisite this repo found missing from both
        shared-state pages is silently irrelevant here; and{" "}
        <code>StateSchema</code> is enforced with zod on both ends of the wire,
        which the shared-state pages never do. The second link in the same

        resolves (200) but is tracked nowhere in this repo and is on the
