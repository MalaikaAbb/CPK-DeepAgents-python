/**
 * Skill delivery, against this repo's Quickstart agent.
 *
 * There is no adapter to mount. The page's LangGraph Python adapter,
 * `copilotkit-intelligence-langgraph`, is not on PyPI (nor is the base client
 * it says Python uses, `copilotkit-intelligence-runtime`), so
 * `create_skill_registry_middleware` cannot be imported and the two tools it
 * would register never exist.
 *
 * The BuiltInAgent row added on 2026-09-21 is not a way round that. It is a
 * different agent, not an adapter for this one -- taking it would mean dropping
 * the Deep Agent this section is about. Its `learnedSkills` option did not
 * exist on runtime 1.71.0; it compiles on the 1.73.3 installed since
 * 2026-09-23. Both of its snippets are in `../built-in-agent-classic.ts` and
 * `../built-in-agent-factory.ts`, verbatim, imported by nothing.
 *
 * So the demo shows the absence rather than faking the presence: the agent is
 * this repo's normal `sample_agent`, and the prompt asks for the exact tool
 * names the page reserves. The agent answers from its own instructions with no
 * tool call, which is what a reader following the page ends up with.
 *
 * The tool names below are quoted from the page's "Read tools" section. They
 * are listed here as text, not registered — registering look-alike tools would
 * make the page appear to work and destroy the finding.
