        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          A checkpoint in front of a side-effecting action. The agent proposes
          one — send an email, update a record, apply a discount — and the run
          stops on an approval card showing what it wants to do, which policy
          reference produced the verdict, and the exact arguments. It runs only
          if you approve.

          The envelope is a plain <code>GovernedAction</code> object with a{" "}
          <code>verdict</code> of <code>allow</code>, <code>deny</code> or{" "}
          <code>require_approval</code>. Only the last one draws buttons; the
          other two resolve themselves from an effect.

      <Callout tone="info" title="The published schema compiles as written">
        <code>z.record(z.unknown())</code> is a zod 3 signature and this repo is
        on zod 3.25.76, so the schema goes in unchanged. It does{" "}
          <em>not</em> compile on zod 4, which is what MsPy-react and AG2-react
        run — the page names no zod version anywhere.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="The `useInterrupt` half is not implementable here">
        The page leads with a <code>useInterrupt</code> variant that reads{" "}
        <code>interrupt?.metadata?.action</code>. <code>Interrupt.metadata</code>{" "}
        is a real optional field on the AG-UI type, so the snippet is
        well-formed — but it needs a backend that pauses a run and attaches an
        action to it, and no agent in this repo does. The page does not say which
        backends can do this, or how the action gets into <code>metadata</code>
        in the first place; it shows only the consuming half. That is the gap,
        and it is why this route takes the tool-call variant instead.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="Nothing enforces the guardrails the page lists">
        The page closes with five guardrails — check policy server-side, use a
        stable <code>id</code> and <code>reference</code> so an approval cannot
        be replayed, show the exact arguments, treat <code>deny</code> as
        terminal, log everything. Every one of them is prose. The code above
        implements none: <code>handleApproval</code> compares{" "}
        <code>actionId</code> and <code>reference</code>, but it is a standalone
        function the page never wires to anything, and the tool variant does not
        call it at all. Follow the snippets and you get an approval UI with no
        replay protection and no audit trail, while the page reads as though it
        covered both.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="The verdict shortcut fires from an effect with a stale dep list">
        <code>GovernedActionCard</code> auto-approves on <code>allow</code> and
        auto-blocks on <code>deny</code> from a <code>useEffect</code> keyed on{" "}
        <code>[action.id, action.verdict]</code> — but the effect calls{" "}
        <code>onApprove</code> and <code>onBlock</code>, neither of which is in
        the dependency array. Linted verbatim,{" "}
        <code>react-hooks/exhaustive-deps</code> reports both as missing, and
        that warning is left standing here rather than silenced — the same call
        Agno-react and Mastra-react made. It happens to work because the handlers
        only close over <code>args</code>, which changes with the id, but it will
        not survive a reader wrapping those handlers in state.
