        <p>
          The Quickstart used to build a v1 <code>CopilotRuntime</code> with an{" "}
          <code>ExperimentalEmptyAdapter</code> at{" "}
          <code>app/api/copilotkit/route.ts</code>. It now builds a v2 one, and
          all three differences break silently if you miss them:
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>1. The import is <code>@copilotkit/runtime/v2</code>.</strong>{" "}
          There is no <code>serviceAdapter</code> on this surface at all —{" "}
          <code>ExperimentalEmptyAdapter</code> has no counterpart.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>
            2. The file is <code>[[...slug]]/route.ts</code>.
          </strong>{" "}
          <code>createCopilotRuntimeHandler</code> serves a whole subtree —{" "}
          <code>/info</code>, agent runs, thread list, rename, delete — so a
          single-segment <code>route.ts</code> 404s everything except the bare
          URL. Four verbs are exported, not one: PATCH and DELETE are how
          threads are renamed and removed.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>
            3. The provider needs <code>useSingleEndpoint={"{false}"}</code>.
          </strong>{" "}
          Omit it and the client posts the bare URL against a multi-route
          handler — every run 404s while <code>/info</code> still answers 200,
          so the app looks connected and does nothing.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="info" title="Two credentials, not one">
        <p>
          <code>INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code> authorizes the runtime against the
          platform: it is what makes <code>/info</code> report{" "}
          <code>mode: &quot;intelligence&quot;</code> and what makes the thread
          endpoints return real rows. Leave it unset and the runtime falls back
          to SSE with an <code>InMemoryAgentRunner</code> — chat still works on
          every route here, but nothing persists across a restart.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <code>COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN</code> is separate, and it is what the{" "}
          <em>client</em> gates features on. <code>/info</code> reports{" "}
          <code>licenseStatus</code> from it, and{" "}
          <code>&lt;CopilotThreadsDrawer&gt;</code> renders its locked
          &ldquo;Upgrade&rdquo; view unless that status is <code>valid</code> or{" "}
          <code>expiring</code> — regardless of whether threads actually work.
          So a runtime can serve threads perfectly while every drawer shows a
          lock. The panel above reports both axes separately for that reason.

          Without it every visitor shares one history. The runtime reads{" "}
