          A card your app puts in the chat on its own — a job finished, a
          socket pushed something — with no agent turn behind it. It is a
          message with <code>role: &quot;activity&quot;</code>: the transcript
          renders it through a registered renderer, and it is stripped from
          every run request, so the model never sees it.

        Step 2&apos;s provider has only <code>runtimeUrl</code> and{" "}

        Deep Agents runtime registers its LangGraph graphs by graph id — the
        Quickstart&apos;s is <code>sample_agent</code> — and has no{" "}
        <code>default</code>. The chat paints, then{" "}
        <code>useAgent()</code> throws the moment <code>/info</code> answers.
        On react-core 1.71.0 the error is not a <code>CopilotKitError</code>,
        so the provider&apos;s own error boundary rethrows it and, without the
        harness boundary this demo adds, it takes the whole route down. The
        page is byte-identical under every framework prefix and never mentions
        the agent id at all.

        The second tab is step 2&apos;s provider plus{" "}
        <code>agent=&quot;sample_agent&quot;</code> — the prop the Deep Agents
        Quickstart puts on its own provider, and not from this page. Checked
        against the request that actually left the browser, not the
        library&apos;s own bookkeeping: with a card in the transcript, the run
        payload to <code>/agent/sample_agent/run</code> carried only{" "}
        <code>user</code>, and the agent answered &quot;I haven&apos;t been
        shown any deployment card in this conversation.&quot; Runtime and
        react-core 1.71.0 (the lockfile then pinned 1.69.0; since 2026-09-23
        the repo declares ^1.73.3 and installs 1.73.3, not re-observed there).

        Until <code>/info</code> answers, <code>useAgent()</code> returns a
        provisional agent (<code>isReady: false</code>). <code>addMessage</code>{" "}
        on it succeeds and even updates <code>agent.messages</code> — and when
        the real agent replaces it a moment later, the card is gone, with no
        error anywhere. Reproduced 3 of 3 on the second tab by clicking with{" "}
        <code>/info</code> held back 4&nbsp;s. The page&apos;s warning is about
        agents you construct yourself; it never mentions <code>isReady</code>,
        which is the only thing that tells you a socket event arriving at
        startup will be dropped.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="Step 3 is never wired to step 2">
        Step 2&apos;s <code>Page</code> renders <code>&lt;CopilotChat /&gt;</code>{" "}

        and never says where it goes. It has to be under the provider for{" "}
        <code>useAgent()</code> to work — this route mounts it there. And its
        socket is <code>wss://example.com/deployments</code>, a placeholder that
        404s the handshake, so mounted as published it never adds a card. The
        demo&apos;s button calls the same <code>addMessage</code>, which the page
        names as an equivalent trigger.
