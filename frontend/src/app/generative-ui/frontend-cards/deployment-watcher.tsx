// Frontend-Driven Cards, step 3 — "Add the card from frontend code". Verbatim,
// file name included (`app/deployment-watcher.tsx` on the page).
//
// Three things the page leaves to the reader, all kept as published:
//   - `wss://example.com/deployments` is a placeholder. Nothing answers there,
//     so mounted as written this component never adds a card.
//   - The page never mounts it. Step 2's `Page` renders `<CopilotChat />` and
//     nothing else, and step 3 does not say where `<DeploymentWatcher />` goes.
//     The demo mounts it inside the step-2 provider, because `useAgent()` only
//     works under one — that placement is this harness's inference.
//   - The bare `useAgent()` asks for the agent id `"default"`. This repo's
//     runtime, like the Deep Agents Quickstart's, registers its LangGraph graphs
//     by graph id and has no `default`, so once the runtime answers `/info` this
//     call throws "Agent 'default' not found after runtime sync". See the demo.
