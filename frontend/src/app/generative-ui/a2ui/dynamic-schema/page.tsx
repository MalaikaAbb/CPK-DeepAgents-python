          The page writes <code>{"<CopilotKit a2ui={{ catalog: myCatalog }}>"}</code>{" "}
          and links to &ldquo;Bring Your Own Catalog&rdquo; for the{" "}
          <code>definitions</code> / <code>renderers</code> /{" "}
          <code>createCatalog</code> split. That link resolves to{" "}
          <code>/generative-ui/a2ui/dynamic-schema</code> — a path outside the
          Deep Agents tree, and in fact a relative link back to a sibling of the
          page itself. The catalog above was supplied for this repo.

      <Callout tone="info" title="Two switches, one on each side">
        <p>
          The page shows <code>injectA2UITool: true</code> on the runtime{" "}
          <em>and</em> <code>a2ui={"{{ catalog }}"}</code> on the provider, as
          though both were needed. Only the provider prop is: passing a catalog
          enables A2UI and injection follows. That is why the runtime for this
          route has no <code>a2ui</code> block, and why the fixed-schema runtime
          has to explicitly set <code>injectA2UITool: false</code> to opt back
          out.

      <Callout tone="info" title="The model id">
        <p>
          The page passes <code>ChatOpenAI(model=&quot;gpt-5.4&quot;)</code>.
          Every agent here reads <code>OPENAI_MODEL</code> instead, defaulting to
          the Quickstart&apos;s <code>gpt-4o</code>. Dynamic A2UI leans on the
          model harder than any other route — a weaker one produces schemas that
          fail the &ldquo;exactly one component with id root&rdquo; rule and
          render blank.
